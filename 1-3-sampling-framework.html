<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Sampling framework</h2>
<p>In both our tactile and our virtual sampling activities, we used sampling for the purpose of estimation. We extracted samples in order to <em>estimate</em> the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red. We used sampling as a less time-consuming approach than performing an exhaustive count of all the balls. Our virtual sampling activity built up to the results shown in Figure <a href="1-2-sampling-simulation.html#fig:comparing-sampling-distributions">1.9</a> and Table <a href="1-2-sampling-simulation.html#tab:comparing-n">1.1</a>: comparing 1000 proportions red based on samples of size 25, 50, and 100. This was our first attempt at understanding two key concepts relating to sampling for estimation:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The effect of <em>sampling variation</em> on our estimates.</li>
<li>The effect of sample size on <em>sampling variation</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you have built some intuition relating to sampling, let’s now attach words and labels to the various concepts we’ve explored so far. Specifically in the next section, we’ll introduce terminology and notation as well as statistical definitions related to sampling. This will allow us to succinctly summarize and refer to the ideas behind sampling for the rest of this book.</p>
<div id="terminology-and-notation" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Terminology and notation</h3>
<p>Let’s now attach words and labels to the various sampling concepts we’ve seen so far by introducing some terminology and mathematical notation. While they may seem daunting at first, we’ll make sure to tie each of them to sampling bowl activities you performed earlier. Furthermore, throughout this book we’ll give you plenty of opportunity for practice, as the best method for mastering these terms is repetition.</p>
<p>The first set of terms and notation relate to <strong>populations</strong>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A <strong>population</strong> is a collection of individuals or observations we are interested in. This is also commonly denoted as a <strong>study population</strong>. We mathematically denote the population’s size using upper-case <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.<br />
</li>
<li>A <strong>population parameter</strong> is some numerical summary about the population that is unknown but you wish you knew. For example, when this quantity is a mean like the average height of all Canadians, the population parameter of interest is the <em>population mean</em>.</li>
<li>A <strong>census</strong> is an exhaustive enumeration or counting of all <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> individuals in the population. We do this in order to compute the population parameter’s value <em>exactly</em>. Of note is that as the number <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> of individuals in our population increases, conducting a census gets more expensive (in terms of time, energy, and money).</li>
</ol>
<p>So in our sampling activities, the <strong>population</strong> is the collection of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> = 2400 identically sized red and white balls in the bowl shown in Figure <a href="1-1-sampling-activity.html#fig:sampling-exercise-1">1.1</a>. Recall that we also represented the bowl “virtually” in the data frame <code>bowl</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="1-3-sampling-framework.html#cb9-1"></a>bowl</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code># A tibble: 2,400 x 2
   ball_ID color
     &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;
 1       1 white
 2       2 white
 3       3 white
 4       4 red  
 5       5 white
 6       6 white
 7       7 red  
 8       8 white
 9       9 red  
10      10 white
# … with 2,390 more rows</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>population parameter</strong> here is the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red. Whenever we’re interested in a proportion of some value in a population, the population parameter has a specific name: the <em>population proportion</em>. We denote population proportions with the letter <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. We’ll see later on in Table <a href="1-6-sampling-conclusion.html#tab:table-ch8">1.5</a> that we can also consider other types of population parameters, like population means and population regression slopes.</p>
<p>In order to compute this population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> exactly, we need to first conduct a <strong>census</strong> by going through all <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> = 2400 and counting the number that are red. We then divide this count by 2400 to obtain the proportion red.</p>
<p>You might be now asking yourself: “Wait. I understand that performing a census on the actual bowl would take a long time. But can’t we conduct a ‘virtual’ census using the virtual bowl?” You are absolutely correct! In fact when the authors of this book created the <code>bowl</code> data frame, they made its contents match the contents of actual bowl not by doing a census, but by reading the contents written on the box the bowl came in!</p>
<p>Let’s conduct this “virtual” census by using the same <code>dplyr</code> verbs you used earlier to count the number of balls that are red:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="1-3-sampling-framework.html#cb11-1"></a>bowl <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb11-2"><a href="1-3-sampling-framework.html#cb11-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">summarize</span>(<span class="dt">red =</span> <span class="kw">sum</span>(color <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> &quot;red&quot;</span>)) </span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code># A tibble: 1 x 1
    red
  &lt;int&gt;
1   900</code></pre>
<p>Since 900 of the 2400 are red, the proportion is 900/2400 = 0.375 = 37.5%. So we know the value of the population parameter: in our case, the population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is equal to 0.375.</p>
<p>At this point, you might be further asking yourself: “If we had a way of knowing that the proportion of the balls that are red is 37.5%, then why did we do any sampling?” Great question! Normally, you wouldn’t do any sampling! However, the sampling activities we did this chapter are merely simulations of how sampling is done in real-life! We perform these simulations in order to study:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The effect of <em>sampling variation</em> on our estimates.</li>
<li>The effect of sample size on <em>sampling variation</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we’ll see in Section <a href="1-4-sampling-case-study.html#sampling-case-study">1.4</a> on polls, in real-life sampling not only will the population size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> be very large making a census expensive, but sometimes we won’t even know how big the population is! For now however, we press on with our next set of terms and notation.</p>
<p>The second set of terms and notation relate to <strong>samples</strong>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Sampling</strong> is the act of collecting a sample from the population, which we generally only do when we can’t perform a census. We mathematically denote the sample size using lower case <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, as opposed to upper case <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> which denotes the population’s size. Typically the sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is much smaller than the population size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. Thus sampling is a much cheaper alternative than performing a census.</li>
<li>A <strong>point estimate</strong>, also known as a <strong>sample statistic</strong>, is a summary statistic computed from a sample that <em>estimates</em> the unknown population parameter.</li>
</ol>
<p>So previously we conducted <strong>sampling</strong> using a shovel with 50 slots to extract samples of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> = 50. To perform the virtual analog of this sampling, recall that we used the <code>rep_sample_n()</code> function as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="1-3-sampling-framework.html#cb13-1"></a>virtual_shovel &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>bowl <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb13-2"><a href="1-3-sampling-framework.html#cb13-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">rep_sample_n</span>(<span class="dt">size =</span> <span class="dv">50</span>)</span>
<span id="cb13-3"><a href="1-3-sampling-framework.html#cb13-3"></a>virtual_shovel</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code># A tibble: 50 x 3
# Groups:   replicate [1]
   replicate ball_ID color
       &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;
 1         1    1970 white
 2         1     842 red  
 3         1    2287 white
 4         1     599 white
 5         1     108 white
 6         1     846 red  
 7         1     390 red  
 8         1     344 white
 9         1     910 white
10         1    1485 white
# … with 40 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Using the sample of 50 balls contained in <code>virtual_shovel</code>, we generated an estimate of the proportion of the bowl’s balls that are red <code>prop_red</code></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="1-3-sampling-framework.html#cb15-1"></a>virtual_shovel <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb15-2"><a href="1-3-sampling-framework.html#cb15-2"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">summarize</span>(<span class="dt">num_red =</span> <span class="kw">sum</span>(color <span class="op">==</span><span class="st"> &quot;red&quot;</span>)) <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span></span>
<span id="cb15-3"><a href="1-3-sampling-framework.html#cb15-3"></a><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">mutate</span>(<span class="dt">prop_red =</span> num_red <span class="op">/</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">50</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code># A tibble: 1 x 3
  replicate num_red prop_red
      &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
1         1      12     0.24</code></pre>
<p>So in our case, the value of <code>prop_red</code> is the <strong>point estimate</strong> of the population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> since it estimates the latter’s value. Furthermore, this point estimate has a specific name when considering proportions: the <em>sample proportion</em>. It is denoted using <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{p}\)</span> because it is a common convention in statistics to use a “hat” symbol to denote point estimates.</p>
<p>The third set of terms relate to <strong>sampling methodology</strong>: the method used to collect samples. You’ll see here and throughout the rest of your book that the <em>way</em> you collect samples directly influences their quality.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A sample is said to be <strong>representative</strong> if it roughly “looks like” the population. In other words, if the sample’s characteristics are a “good” representation of the population’s characteristics.</li>
<li>We say a sample is <strong>generalizable</strong> if any results based on the sample can generalize to the population. In other words, if we can make “good” guesses about the population using the sample.</li>
<li>We say a sampling procedure is <strong>biased</strong> if certain individuals in a population have a higher chance of being included in a sample than others. We say a sampling procedure is <strong>unbiased</strong> if every individual in a population has an equal chance of being sampled.</li>
</ol>
<p>We say a sample of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> balls extracted using our shovel is <strong>representative</strong> of the population if it’s contents “roughly resemble” the contents of the bowl. If so, then the proportion of the shovel’s balls that are red can <strong>generalize</strong> to the proportion of the bowl’s <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> = 2400 balls that are red. Or expressed differently, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{p}\)</span> is a “good guess” of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Now say we cheated when using the shovel and removed a number of white balls in favor of red balls. Then this sample would be <strong>biased</strong> towards red balls, and thus the sample would no longer be representative of the bowl.</p>
<p>The fourth and final set of terms and notation relate to the goal of sampling:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>One way to ensure that a sample is unbiased and representative of the population is by using <strong>random sampling</strong></li>
<li><strong>Inference</strong> is the act of “making a guess” about some unknown. <strong>Statistical inference</strong> is the act of making a guess about a population using a sample.</li>
</ol>
<p>In our case, since the <code>rep_sample_n()</code> function uses your computer’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation">random number generator</a>, we were in fact performing <strong>random sampling</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s now put all four sets of terms and notation together, keeping our sampling activities in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since we extracted a sample of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> = 50 balls at <em>random</em>, in other words we mixed all of the equally sized balls before using the shovel, then</li>
<li>the contents of the shovel are <em>unbiased</em> and <em>representative</em> of the contents of the bowl, thus</li>
<li>any result based on the shovel can <em>generalize</em> to the bowl, thus</li>
<li>the sample proportion <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{p}\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> = 50 balls in the shovel that are red is a “good guess” of the population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of the bowl’s <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> = 2400 balls that are red, thus</li>
<li>instead of conducting a <em>census</em> of the 2400 balls in the bowl, we can <strong>infer</strong> about the bowl using the sample from the shovel.</li>
</ul>
<p>What you have been performing is <strong>statistical inference</strong>. This is one of the most important concepts in all of statistics. So much so, we included this term in the title of our book: “Statistial Inference via Data Science”. More generally speaking,</p>
<ul>
<li>If the sampling of a sample of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is done at <em>random</em>, then</li>
<li>the sample is <em>unbiased</em> and <em>representative</em> of the population of size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, thus</li>
<li>any result based on the sample can <em>generalize</em> to the population, thus</li>
<li>the point estimate is a “good guess” of the unknown population parameter, thus</li>
<li>instead of performing a census, we can <em>infer</em> about the population using sampling.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the upcoming Chapter <a href="#confidence-intervals"><strong>??</strong></a> on confidence intervals, we’ll introduce the <code>infer</code> package, which makes statistical inference “tidy” and transparent. It is why this third portion of the book is called “Statistical inference via infer.”</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Statistical definitions</h3>
<p>To further attach words and labels to the various sampling concepts we’ve seen so far, we also introduce some important statistical definitions related to sampling. As a refresher of our 1000 repeated/replicated virtual samples of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> = 25, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> = 50, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> = 100 in Section <a href="1-2-sampling-simulation.html#sampling-simulation">1.2</a>, let’s display Figure <a href="1-2-sampling-simulation.html#fig:comparing-sampling-distributions">1.9</a> again as Figure <a href="1-3-sampling-framework.html#fig:comparing-sampling-distributions-1b">1.10</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>These types of distributions have a special name: <strong>sampling distributions of point estimates</strong>.  Their visualization displays the effect of sampling variation on the distribution of any point estimate, in this case, the sample proportion <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{p}\)</span>. Using these sampling distributions, for a given sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, we can make statements about what values we can typically expect. Unfortunately, the term <em>sampling distribution</em> is often confused with a <em>sample’s distribution</em> which is merely the distribution of the values in a single sample.</p>
<!--
TODO: Insert table distinguishing "sampling distribution of point estimates" vs "a sample's distribution"
-->
<p>For example, observe the centers of all three sampling distributions: they are all roughly centered around 0.4 = 40%. Furthermore, observe that while we are somewhat likely to observe sample proportions of red balls of 0.2 = 20% when using the shovel with 25 slots, we will almost never observe a proportion of 20% when using the shovel with 100 slots. Observe also the effect of sample size on the sampling variation. As the sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> increases from 25 to 50 to 100,  the variation of the sampling distribution decreases and thus the values cluster more and more tightly around the same center of around 40%. We quantified this variation using the standard deviation of our sample proportions in Table <a href="1-2-sampling-simulation.html#tab:comparing-n">1.1</a>, which we display again as Table <a href="1-3-sampling-framework.html#tab:comparing-n-repeat">1.2</a>:</p>

<p>So as the sample size increases, the standard deviation of the proportion of red balls decreases. This type of standard deviation has another special name:  <strong>standard error of a point estimate</strong>. Standard errors quantify the effect of sampling variation induced on our estimates. In other words, they quantify how much we can expect different proportions of a shovel’s balls that are red <em>to vary</em> from one sample to another sample to another sample, and so on. As a general rule, as sample size increases, the standard error decreases.</p>
<p>Similarly to confusion between <em>sampling distributions</em> with <em>a sample’s distribution</em>, people often confuse the <em>standard error</em> with the <em>standard deviation</em>. This is especially the case since a standard error is itself a kind of standard deviation. The best advice we can give is that a standard error is merely a <em>kind</em> of standard deviation: the standard deviation of any point estimate from sampling. In other words, all standard errors are standard deviations, but not every standard deviation is necessarily a standard error.</p>
<p>To help reinforce these concepts, let’s re-display Figure <a href="1-2-sampling-simulation.html#fig:comparing-sampling-distributions">1.9</a> but using our new terminology, notation, and definitions relating to sampling in Figure <a href="1-3-sampling-framework.html#fig:comparing-sampling-distributions-2">1.11</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.3</span> The moral of the story</h3>
<p>Let’s recap this section so far. We’ve seen that if a sample is generated at random, then the resulting point estimate is a “good guess” of the true unknown population parameter. In our sampling activities, since we made sure to mix the balls first before extracting a sample with the shovel, the resulting sample proportion <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{p}\)</span> of the shovel’s balls that were red was a “good guess” of the population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of the bowl’s balls that were red.</p>
<p>However, what do we mean by our point estimate being a “good guess”? Sometimes, we’ll get an estimate that is less than the true value of the population parameter, while at other times we’ll get an estimate that is greater. This is due to sampling variation. However, despite this sampling variation, our estimates will “on average” be correct and thus will be centered at the true value. This is because our sampling was done at random and thus in an unbiased fashion.</p>
<p>In our sampling activities, sometimes our sample proportion <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{p}\)</span> was less than the true population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, while at other times it was greater. This was due to the sampling variability. However, despite this sampling variation, our sample proportions <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{p}\)</span> were “on average” correct and thus were centered at the true value of the population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. This is because we mixed our bowl before taking samples and thus the sampling was done at random and thus in an unbiased fashion. This is also known as having an <em>accurate</em> estimate.</p>
<p>Recall from earlier that the value of the population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> = 2400 balls in the bowl was 900/2400 = 0.375 = 37.5%. We computed this value by performing a virtual census of <code>bowl</code>. Let’s re-display our sampling distributions from Figures <a href="1-2-sampling-simulation.html#fig:comparing-sampling-distributions">1.9</a> and <a href="1-3-sampling-framework.html#fig:comparing-sampling-distributions-2">1.11</a>, but now with a vertical red line marking the true population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of balls that are red = 37.5% in Figure <a href="1-3-sampling-framework.html#fig:comparing-sampling-distributions-3">1.12</a>. We see that while there is a certain amount of error in the sample proportions <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{p}\)</span> for all three sampling distributions, on average the <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{p}\)</span> are centered at the true population proportion red <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:comparing-sampling-distributions-3"></span>

<p class="caption">
FIGURE 1.12: Three sampling distributions with population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> marked by vertical line.
</p>
</div>
<p>We also saw in this section that as your sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> increases, your point estimates will vary less and less and be more and more concentrated around the true population parameter. This variation is quantified by the decreasing <em>standard error</em>. In other words, the typical error of your point estimates will decrease. In our sampling exercise, as the sample size increased, the variation of our sample proportions <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{p}\)</span> decreased. You can observe this behavior in Figure <a href="1-3-sampling-framework.html#fig:comparing-sampling-distributions-3">1.12</a>. This is also known as having a <em>precise</em> estimate.</p>
<p>So random sampling ensures our point estimates are <em>accurate</em>, while on the other hand having a large sample size ensures our point estimates are <em>precise</em>. While the terms “accuracy” and “precision” may sound like they mean the same thing, there is a subtle difference. Accuracy describes how “on target” our estimates are, whereas precision describes how “consistent” our estimates are. Figure <a href="1-3-sampling-framework.html#fig:accuracy-vs-precision">1.13</a> illustrates the difference.</p>

<p>At this point, you might be asking yourself: “Why did we take 1000 repeated samples of size n = 25, 50, and 100? Shouldn’t we be taking only <em>one</em> sample that’s as large as possible?”. If you did ask yourself these questions, your suspicion is correct! Recall from earlier when we asked ourselves “If we had a way of knowing that the proportion of the balls that are red is 37.5%, then why did we do any sampling?” Similarly, we took 1000 repeated samples as a simulation of how sampling is done in real-life! We used these simulations to study:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The effect of <em>sampling variation</em> on our estimates.</li>
<li>The effect of sample size on <em>sampling variation</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not how sampling is done in real life! In a real-life scenario, we wouldn’t take 1000 repeated/replicated samples, but rather a single sample that’s as large as we can afford. In Section <a href="1-4-sampling-case-study.html#sampling-case-study">1.4</a>, we’re going to study a real-life example of sampling: polls.</p>
